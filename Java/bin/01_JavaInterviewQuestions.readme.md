üîπ Topics Interviewers Commonly Ask Freshers in Java
1. Core Java (most important)

This is the foundation. Expect the majority of questions here:

OOP concepts (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction)

Difference between abstract class and interface

Difference between == and .equals()

What is hashCode() and equals() contract

Access modifiers (public, private, protected, default)

static keyword (variables, methods, blocks)

final, finally, finalize

Difference between String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer

Exception handling (try, catch, finally, checked vs unchecked exceptions)

Collections Framework (List, Set, Map, differences between them)

Multithreading basics (Thread vs Runnable, synchronized, volatile)

2. Java 8 Features (they might ask at a basic level)

Since most companies now use Java 8 or above, they may check if you‚Äôre familiar with:

Lambda expressions (basic syntax, why used)

Functional Interfaces (e.g., Runnable, Comparator, Consumer)

Streams API (basic operations: map, filter, forEach)

Optional (to avoid NullPointerException)

Method references (Class::methodName)
üëâ But for a fresher, usually just conceptual or simple coding examples.

3. Coding/Problem-Solving

They‚Äôll test your logic more than syntax. Questions may look like:

Reverse a string or number

Find factorial, Fibonacci series

Check palindrome / anagram

Find duplicates in an array or string

Implement sorting without using built-in methods

Use Collections (e.g., count word frequency with HashMap)

Write a simple program using OOP (e.g., create BankAccount class with deposit/withdraw)

4. Database Basics (SQL)

Basic SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE queries

JOIN types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)

Difference between PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY

Indexing basics

5. Other Concepts (depends on company)

Basic DSA (Arrays, Strings, Stack/Queue, LinkedList, HashMap)

JDBC basics (how to connect Java to DB)

If they use Spring Boot, maybe a high-level question: ‚ÄúWhat is dependency injection?‚Äù

üîπ So, do they ask Java 8 questions for freshers?

üëâ Yes, but not in depth.
They may ask:

‚ÄúWhat is a lambda expression?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you show how to use streams to filter even numbers from a list?‚Äù

But they will not expect you to master advanced functional programming right away. Core Java + Problem Solving is most important.

üîπ Interview Preparation Tips for Freshers

Be very confident in Core Java concepts.

Practice coding problems (HackerRank, LeetCode Easy level).

Learn basic SQL queries.

Revise OOP concepts ‚Äî almost always asked.

Know basic Java 8 features (just to show you‚Äôre up to date).
