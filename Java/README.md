# ðŸŽ¯ Java Fresher Interview Preparation Guide

This guide covers **important topics, sample questions, and preparation tips** for freshers interviewing for **Java Developer** roles.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Core Java (Most Important)

Interviewers focus heavily on **Core Java** for freshers. Be clear about fundamentals.

### Key Topics:
- OOP Concepts: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction
- Abstract class vs Interface
- Difference between `==` and `.equals()`
- `hashCode()` and `equals()` contract
- Access Modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, default
- `static` keyword: variables, methods, blocks
- Difference between `final`, `finally`, `finalize`
- `String` vs `StringBuilder` vs `StringBuffer`
- Exception Handling: `try`, `catch`, `finally`, checked vs unchecked exceptions
- Collections Framework: `List`, `Set`, `Map`, differences between them
- Basics of Multithreading: `Thread` vs `Runnable`, `synchronized`, `volatile`

### Sample Questions:
1. What are the four main pillars of OOP?
2. Difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?
3. What is the difference between `throw` and `throws`?
4. Can we override a static method in Java?
5. Difference between `HashMap` and `Hashtable`?

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Java 8 Features (Basic Level for Freshers)

Most companies now use Java 8 or higher. As a fresher, you should **know the basics**.

### Key Topics:
- **Lambda Expressions** â†’ `(a, b) -> a + b`
- **Functional Interfaces** â†’ e.g., `Runnable`, `Comparator`, `Consumer`
- **Streams API** â†’ `map()`, `filter()`, `forEach()`
- **Optional** â†’ Avoiding `NullPointerException`
- **Method References** â†’ `ClassName::methodName`

### Sample Questions:
1. What is a lambda expression? Why is it useful?
2. Can you write a stream to filter even numbers from a list?
3. What is the difference between a normal interface and a functional interface?

---

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Coding / Problem Solving

Logic matters more than syntax. Expect **simple coding challenges**.

### Common Problems:
- Reverse a string or number
- Find factorial, Fibonacci series
- Check palindrome / anagram
- Find duplicates in an array or string
- Implement sorting without built-in methods
- Count word frequency using `HashMap`
- Simple OOP program (e.g., `BankAccount` with deposit/withdraw)

---

## ðŸ“Œ 4. Database Basics (SQL)

Even for Java roles, **SQL knowledge** is often tested.

### Key Topics:
- Basic CRUD queries: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- `JOIN` types: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT
- Difference between `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY`
- Indexing basics

### Sample Questions:
1. Write a query to find the second highest salary.
2. What is the difference between `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`?
3. What is the difference between `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DROP`?

---

## ðŸ“Œ 5. Other Important Areas

Some companies may ask **extra topics**:
- **DSA basics**: Arrays, Strings, Stack, Queue, LinkedList, HashMap
- **JDBC basics**: How Java connects to databases
- **Spring / Spring Boot** (very basic, if used in the company)
  - Example: *What is Dependency Injection?*

---

## ðŸ“Œ 6. Do Freshers Need Java 8+ Knowledge?

ðŸ‘‰ Yes, but **only at a basic level**.  
Expect simple conceptual or coding questions like:
- *"What is a lambda expression?"*
- *"Use streams to print all even numbers in a list."*

You wonâ€™t be expected to master advanced functional programming.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 7. Interview Preparation Tips

âœ… Be confident in **Core Java** concepts.  
âœ… Practice **easy coding problems** (HackerRank, LeetCode Easy).  
âœ… Learn **basic SQL queries**.  
âœ… Revise **OOP principles** (always asked).  
âœ… Know **Java 8 basics** (to stay updated).

## ðŸ“Œ 8. Sample 20 Questions for Practice

1. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
2. Explain the four pillars of OOP.
3. Difference between `==` and `.equals()`?
4. Why is `String` immutable in Java?
5. Explain `StringBuilder` vs `StringBuffer`.
6. What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `Vector`?
7. Difference between `HashSet` and `TreeSet`.
8. Explain the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.
9. How does `HashMap` work internally?
10. What are lambda expressions in Java 8?
11. Show an example of using streams to filter a list.
12. What is the purpose of the `Optional` class?
13. Difference between `throw` and `throws`.
14. What is multithreading? How do you create a thread in Java?
15. Difference between `synchronized` method and block.
16. What is a functional interface? Give an example.
17. Write a program to check if a string is a palindrome.
18. Write a SQL query to find the second highest salary.
19. What is the difference between `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DROP`?
20. What is dependency injection in Spring?

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Note

As a fresher:
- **Core Java + Problem Solving** is the priority.
- **Basic SQL** will help you stand out.
- **Java 8 features** (just basics) show that youâ€™re updated with modern practices.

Good luck with your interviews ðŸš€
